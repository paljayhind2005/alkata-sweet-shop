🔥 My AI Usage (Mandatory Section)

This project was developed with responsible and transparent use of AI tools. Below is the detailed breakdown of how AI assisted my workflow.

✔ AI Tools Used

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

GitHub Copilot

Gemini (Google)

✔ How I Used AI

Project Ideation & Structure

Used ChatGPT to brainstorm project folder structure and component architecture.

Asked for guidance on selecting tech stack (React + Astro + Tailwind).

Code Assistance

Used GitHub Copilot to auto-complete React components and utility functions.

Used AI to generate initial versions of repetitive UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs).

Debugging & Optimization

Asked ChatGPT to explain Astro build errors and TypeScript issues.

Used AI suggestions to improve state management with Zustand and validation with Zod.

Documentation

README.md initial draft and refinement written with AI support.

AI helped me rewrite instructions in a more professional format.

Testing Support

Used AI to help generate sample Vitest test cases, which I customized and refined manually.

✔ Impact of AI on My Workflow (Reflection)

AI significantly increased development speed, especially for boilerplate code.

Helped me learn faster—especially on integrating Astro + React.

Improved code consistency and readability.

However, all logic, architecture decisions, and core implementation were written by me to ensure full understanding and originality.

AI acted as a coding partner, not as a replacement.
